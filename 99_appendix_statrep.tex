\section{Appendix: How to compile a StatRep document\label{sec:statrep}}

When you use the \Statrep \LaTeX\ package, you use the following
four-step process to create an executable document that
enables you to ensure that your research results are reproducible:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create your \LaTeX\ document so that it contains your text,
data, and SAS code.

\item Compile your document with pdf\LaTeX\ to generate the SAS
program.

\item Execute the SAS program to capture your output. For each
code block in your document, SAS creates a SAS Output Delivery System (ODS)
document that contains the resulting output.

For each output request in your document, SAS replays the
specified output objects to external files. All your
requested output is generated and captured when you execute
the generated SAS program.

\item Recompile your \LaTeX\ document. In this step, the
requested outputs are embedded in the resulting final PDF document.

You might need to repeat this step so that \LaTeX\ can measure the
listing outputs to ensure that they are framed appropriately.
\end{enumerate}
